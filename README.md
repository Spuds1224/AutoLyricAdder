# AutoLyricAdder
Automatically adds lyric metadata to .mp3 files

## .exe file
Unzip the file and run AutoLyricAdder.exe

(Windows may try to quarantine it because running a python script like this is... lets say unconventional... the source code is right here so you can see that everything is legit)
